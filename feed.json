However, most fruit trees require a \"chilling period\" in the winter. To the naked eye, the tree looks dead. In reality, it is performing essential internal chemistry to prepare for the spring.</p>\n<p data-path-to-node=\"9\">If you feel like you are in a \"winter\" phase of your life—where nothing is blooming, and everything feels cold—you aren't failing. You are <strong data-path-to-node=\"9\" data-index-in-node=\"138\">accumulating the energy</strong> necessary for the next burst of growth. If the tree tried to bloom in December, the blossoms would freeze. Waiting for the \"correct time\" is often a matter of survival.</p>\n<h4 data-path-to-node=\"10\">Synchronicity with the Environment</h4>\n<p data-path-to-node=\"11\">Fruit doesn't just ripen for itself; it ripens for the environment. It waits for the pollinators to be active and the conditions to be just right so its seeds can survive.</p>\n<p data-path-to-node=\"12\">Your \"correct time\" is often tethered to things outside of your control:</p>\n<ul data-path-to-node=\"13\">\n<li>\n<p data-path-to-node=\"13,0,0\">The <strong data-path-to-node=\"13,0,0\" data-index-in-node=\"4\">market</strong> needs to be ready for your idea.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p data-path-to-node=\"13,1,0\">The <strong data-path-to-node=\"13,1,0\" data-index-in-node=\"4\">other person</strong> needs to be ready for your love.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p data-path-to-node=\"13,2,0\">The <strong data-path-to-node=\"13,2,0\" data-index-in-node=\"4\">opening</strong> needs to exist in the company you want to join.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p data-path-to-node=\"14\">When you try to \"fall from the tree\" too early, you land on hard ground before anyone is there to catch you.
